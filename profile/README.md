**Building powerful Kotlin tools for developers**

We create high-quality, developer-focused tools and libraries that make Kotlin development more productive and enjoyable.

## 🛠️ Our Projects

### 🌐 KTML
Fast component-based HTML template engine for Kotlin on the JVM or with KMP. A modern, type-safe solution for generating clean, maintainable HTML with the full power of Kotlin's type system.

### 🌐 Z85
A pure Kotlin implementation of the Z85 encoding that's compatible with all KMP targets. Z85 is a text encoding for binary data (like Base64), but is more
efficient than Base 64. While Base 64 add 33% size to data, Z85 only adds 25%.

### 📦 KtEmbed
Tool for embedding static resources into a Kotlin application (JVM and Kotlin Native), making resource management seamless and efficient.

### 🧪 Kotest BDD
BDD Spec class for Kotest - simplified Behavior-Driven Development testing.

### 🏗️ Kotlin-Gen
Kotlin Code Generation Library - library for writing Kotlin code that generates Kotlin code files.

## 🎯 Our Mission
